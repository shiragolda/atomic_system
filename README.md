# atomic_system
Python code for calculating atomic matrix elements, dipole operators, atomic polarizabilities, etc. for an atomic species using known energy levels and oscillator strengths. 

Included are calcium energy levels from the NIST database and calcium oscillator strengths from https://doi.org/10.1016/j.adt.2017.03.002. Energy levels and oscillator strengths for strontium and helium from the NIST database are included as well.  

calculate_dynamic_polariabilities.py: Code used to calculate dynamic polarizabilities for two-photon clock states in calcium
calculate_two_photon_Rabi_frequencies.py: Code used to calculate two-photon Rabi frequencies for two-photon clock based on calcium.
